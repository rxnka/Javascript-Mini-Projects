      "NF (Nathan John Feuerstein) is an American rapper, singer and songwriter. He is known for his relatable lyrics and catchy beats. Born and raised in Michigan, US, he had a difficult childhood. He found relief in listening as well as creating music and channelized his inner turmoil and anger through his songs, but, interestingly, his lyrics are without any curse words, crime or despair. Listeners effortlessly identify with his honest words and raw emotions, and this has gained him a huge following. He has topped both ‘Christian Hip-Hop’ and the ‘Mainstream Hip-Hop.’ NF has signed with the major ‘Christian Music’ label (Capitol CMG) in the US, so he is considered a ‘Christian rapper,’ but he prefers to call himself ‘an artist who makes music for everybody.’ His EP, ‘NF,’ released in 2014, brought him the breakthrough success. He followed its success with three studio albums in three years - ‘Mansion,’ ‘Therapy Session’ and ‘Perception.’ His single, ‘Let You Down,’ from ‘Perception’ was certified triple platinum. ‘Real’ is his most watched video with 18 million views on the ‘YouTube.’";

He grew up at a time when ‘YouTube’ was a major platform for young artists to showcase their talents. He debuted on ‘YouTube’ in 2016, with his single ‘Paper Crown.’ Earlier, in 2014, ‘Columbia Records’ had offered him a contract and had promised to produce his debut album. However, they had dropped him later. Nevertheless, Alec continued to work on his music.
